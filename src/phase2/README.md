# Phase 2: Web page 🖱️
The frontend code is based on [Azure OpenAI chat frontend sample](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-openai-chat-frontend). After creating a RAG chatbot in [Phase 1](../phase1/README.md), can run the web page locally using these steps:

## 1. Setup backend
In the `backend` folder run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## 2. Setup frontend
In the `frontend` folder run `npm install`

## 3. Run application
In the `phase2` folder run `npm run start-backend` and `npm run start-frontend` (in another terminal)
