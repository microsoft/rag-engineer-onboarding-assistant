## Overview

This sample implements a RAG assistant for onboarding new engineers as well as an interface for chatting with the assistant. 

### Context & Problem üí≠
Onboarding can be challenging and overwhelming, especially for interns and new graduates üéì. A significant part of onboarding involves learning the common knowledge base within the team üß†. While team members can easily explain these topics, they often seem complex or confusing to newcomers. 

### Goals & Approach üöÄ
The goal of this sample is to build a resource that eases the onboarding process for newcomers and alleviates the workload of team members who assist them.

### Phase 1: RAG Chatbot ü§ñ
This first part of this sample is based on the [Azure AI RAG Workshop](https://github.com/nitya/azure-ai-rag-workshop).

### Phase 2: Web page üñ±Ô∏è
The second part of this sample allows users to interact with the RAG Chatbot from Phase 1, modifying the [Azure OpenAI chat frontend sample](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-openai-chat-frontend)
